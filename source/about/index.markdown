## Medevice
Medevice is a github organization.

![crowdsource](https://gist.github.com/bewest/4733115/raw/12e6b77e3b9263a4b2e7bb546667d18fd031ace7/crowdsource-diabetes-tech.png)

Idea is to provide a locus for patients and vendors to solve technical problems
together, enabling everyone to participate in improving care to the best of
their ability.
