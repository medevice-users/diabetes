  Includes pictures of working beaglebone, orchestrating the "data bus" between
  several connected devices, and the internet at large.
* [insulware](https://github.com/n-west/insulware) - mash up
  beaglebone, meta-insulaudit, and insulaudit altogether in one
  package to audit gucometers over the internet using 3G!

  Considering extending gitolite.  ssh based application that
  sets up a transport, then uses insulaudit or related tools.
