## Backend

Assume you have a bunch of decentralized "agents," implemented in many
languages, and all have data to report.

We'll need bits of the following types of software tailored for use by
a diabetic data bus:

If you've got software to keep records, allow read/write access to
them, add it to the list.

* asset management/inventory
* basic auditing/accounting/record keeping

  * [opendatabetes](http://opendatabetes.com) - an open standard for recording/sharing diabetes data - very early days 
  * [sanguine](http://sanguinediabetes.com) - WIP glucose/insulin/pump tracking app. In prototype, to be rebuilt using web technologies

* stats/data/mining
* authorization and authentication
* transport-independence - orchestrate which sockets, ports to use, etc.

  * [netspective](https://github.com/netspective) may be of help

* [manageBGL](http://manageBGL.com) pump simulator and data visualization with API
