## Device IO

The data on these devices belongs to us.  Let's get audit the data:
* [insulaudit](https://github.com/bewest/insulaudit) - this project consumes many libraries to re-format data in a prefered format

### Decoder rings
These projects collect packet captures, provide tests suites, and tools to
communicate with medical devices.  Application authors can use these
tools to analyze and debug devices, exercise their decoding skills, or
contribute to language-independent test suites, or even help implement
the protocols.

* [decoding-carelink](https://github.com/bewest/decoding-carelink)
* [decoding-omnipod](https://github.com/bewest/decoding-omnipod)
* [decoding-onetouchping](https://github.com/bewest/decoding-onetouchping)
* [decoding-dexcom](https://github.com/bewest/decoding-dexcom)
* [decoding-bayer](https://gist.github.com/4696755)
* [glucodump](https://bitbucket.org/iko/glucodump/src/e37ea2a38776/glucodump/usbcomm.py)

Unit tests, docs, protocol schematics, ports to other languages.

Help with the "decoder rings," some have data available, ready to
analyze, some need captures!
