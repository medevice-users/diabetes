# Bayer Cares about diabetes

Author: Ben West

What follows is the result I got from a request through Bayer's
website for the protocol.  I can't thank them enough for their
no-nonsense reply.  This is the kind of response that indicates they
really mean what they say when they care about people with diabetes.

I'm now testing the Contour, and am considering switching to it and
recommending it heavily.  It has a usb storage device.  It may be
possible to boot the beaglebone or similar from such a device; I
intend to find out sometime.

I will now attempt to provide a faithful transcription of the pdf.
