# Redesigning Diabetes
## a Bazaar rather than a Cathedral approach to Diabetes

A project that began with a conversation between Ben West, Elsa Kaminsky, and Joyce Lee.

## Goals
There are design problems at multiple levels of the diabetes landscape, which could be addressed by the collective efforts of the  community. The objective of this collaborative project is:

1)To identify the design problems in diabetes;
2)To provide a comprehensive map of these design problems, and link them to possible solutions proposed by community members;
3) To provide an organizational structure to allow members of the community to serve as leads volunteers and connect with other volunteers who want to work on a particular problem.

Here is the beginning of a list of the design problems: Please add to it as you wish! 

## Stakeholders, audience, desisgn problems
Regulatory: slower process of FDA regulation of medical devices and software.
Industry: A competitive landscape that leads individuals companies to have their own proprietary systems for which they don't want to share code or protocols
Third party payer: Lack of insurance for individuals with diabetes
Lack of coverage for specific types of medications and technologies (pumps, CGMs,)

### Health Care Entities
Lack of access to medical history/records
### Daycares
inflexiblity of daycare providers to provide support and adequate supervision for children with diabetes
### Schools
For schoolage kids: inflexiblity of school providers to provide support and adequate supervision for children with diabetes
### Clinics
Difficulty with finding a patient centered provider, Difficulty with getting convenient appointment times, Lack of effective resources for self-management
### Fidelity of care
Lack of transition training programs for adolescents and young adults. Lack of ability to send blood sugars to physicians for review.  lack of clinicians' ability to use texting and mobile technology for clinical care.  (Joyce Lee)
### Technology
Lack of interoperability of blood glucose systems resulting in multiple meter and pumps and cgm that do not talk with each other,
Lack of a unified display that allows multiple streams of data to be reviewed and used for actionable decisionmaking. 
### Devices
Medtonic CGM sensor is painful; "it's more work to take care of than the diabetes"

### Interfaces
Lack of ability of users of insulin pumps to create a user interface that is tailored to their needs. (Ben West) https://github.com/medevice-users/diabetes#projects
